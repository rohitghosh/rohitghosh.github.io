Rohit here. Currently, working as <strong>Founding Member &amp; Chief Commercial Officer</strong> at <a href="https://qure.ai">Qure.ai</a>. Qure.ai focuses on AI for medical imaging and is currently being used in 50+ countries, 2000+ provider sites globally. Within Qure, I am currently responsible for business development and strategy for existing business verticals. My learnings are primarily around entering new segments for a B2B business and scalign them. I will try and consolidate my learnings on this blog. Ironaically, this is what I have been doing day-in day-out for since 2018.</p>

<p>I have also done a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUq3VabF93w">TEDX talk</a> in the meantime talking about the journey of Qure and the problem we’re trying to solve. Also, in the intervenign years, I got a chance to mentor and coach 200+ students as a faculty at GreyAtom. In collaboration with GreyAtom, we put out a series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYRC9o9jyT8&amp;list=PLLkSL3qYv6EK3kS98sqNAqSZsMqc8AhhV">YouTube lectures</a> on machine learning and AI which could help anyone get started with data science.</p>

<p>From 2019-2021, I worked with Google Developer Expert Group for machine learning to mentor/coach budding data scientists across the globe to learn data science. Have travelled to 20+ conferences as part of the role to meet and give talks about interesting aspects of explainability of machine learning.</p>

<p>As teaching machine learning very close to my heart, I also happened to co-author a book titled <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=tJm2DwAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s">Big Data Analytics: Systems, Algorithms, Applications</a> along with Prof. Prabhu and his student (<em>it was a lot of effort writing even few chapters!</em>)</p>

<p>A 2014 graduate from IIT Bombay, I had worked Nomura right after graduation.  Before Qure, I had worked as Data Scientist for <a href="http://listup.co.in/">ListUp</a>, a P2P buy-sell platform and as Freelance Data Scientist for New York based startup <a href="https://datascilabs.com/">Data Science Labs</a> and couple of other startups.</p>

<p>Early on in Qure I used to mostly on R&amp;D areas in computer vision part of Deep Learning. In addition to vision, I also keenly follow developments in reinforcement learning (mostly related to trading strategies). Also, on weekends, I am mostly playing either playing tennis or at swimming pool. An avid Hindi music buff, I like to read on varied topics, and keep a tab on the newest breakthroughs. Hence, a varied lot of topics in the <a href="https://rohitghosh.github.io/">blog</a>.</p>
