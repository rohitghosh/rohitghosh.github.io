        Why Tinder works? Solving for X in Tinder for X (Part 2/2)
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2016</span>

    <p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-tinder-works-insights-how-build-addictive-products-nivedan-rathi">Part 1</a>, we delved into the user psychology of what makes Tinder such an addictive product and what are its takeaways for your business idea in general. We’ve all heard a lot about the Uber for X model now, where X has been abused and overused a lot (2016 is an especially interesting time for these startups). Let’s talk about the other cool thing - Tinder for X. So we ventured out to find what makes or break a Tinder for X model where X could be different industries like recruitment, shopping etc.</p>

<p>Let’s begin with all the major criteria for any business problem to be suited for Tinder for X model</p>

<ul>
  <li>Should connect 2 communities who need each other</li>
  <li>Availability of almost infinite options to swipe for both communities</li>
  <li>Any wrong decisions should have little downside</li>
  <li>Snap judgement to proceed to the next meaningful step should be possible</li>
  <li>Very little but highly significant information must be presented</li>
  <li>Choices should be ideally binary &amp; execution virtually zero effort (Tinder-swipe)</li>
  <li>Should offer variability in rewards</li>
  <li>Should trigger the emotion of ego boost from a “match”</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, let’s look at some of the Tinder for X model, solving for X we get</p>

<dl>
<dt>X = Employer / Job-seeker | Major Apps : Super(India), Jobr</dt>

<dd>Looking for jobs had been made easier over the years but a Tinder-like model beats everyone in engagement. There are endless startup jobs &amp; an equal number of young grads on the app validate the effectiveness and need of the idea. Obviously, there’s also an ‘ego boost’ for an employee, as well as for the employer to some extent, whenever there’s a ‘match’.

However, it’s not a snap judgement for neither the employer nor the employee - it definitely takes second thoughts unless of course you’re in your notice period or the appraisal you’ve been waiting desperately for 2 years just went to someone else in the organisation. Moreover, the lack of Job Description only adds to the trouble. Also, for an employee, there’s definitely a lot of financial downside to a left swipe - that could mean a family holiday at Mauritius being just (s)wiped away!</dd>

<dt>X = Entrepreneur / Investor | Major Apps : Tendr , PIF</dt>

<dd>For investors sifting through a heap of startups daily, these apps are definitely a need of the hour for the investor community. Also, these apps levels field for ‘techie’ founders with limited networks. Obviously, the ‘ego boost’ exists predominantly for an entrepreneur whenever he gets a ‘right’ swipe from an investor.

Again, it would never be a snap judgement. Judging business potential isn’t as cognitive as judging people for hook-up, even for a seasoned investor. Forget business potential, even a beauty pageant where the sole job was to judge beauty by gazing- they ended up asking GK questions.

Also, an endless supply of investors would be tough. However, can’t comment same about no. of entrepreneurs in India these days. It’s only time till the Vijay Mallya raises investment for bail as well. Moreover, a high probability of financial downside for missing out a potential business idea for an investor makes snap judgement even harder.</dd>

<dt>X = Online shopper / online store | Major Apps: Mallzee. Hit or Miss</dt>

<dd>Definitely a must-have app for an ever deal-hungry consumer - what better than looking through an endless stack and dismissing based on % of discount. Given these days of deep-discounted customer acquisition strategy, judging based on discount is more cognitive than judging strangers.

However, this idea fails miserably on the ‘ego boost’ front. A store would never swipe left a customer, so basically it’s never a ‘match’ in the truest sense. Given a customer knows that he would always be swiped right, there’s no thrill or as such ‘variable reward’ (check the Part 1 for details)</dd>

<dt>X = News/ Home-hunt/ Food | Major Apps : InShorts, HomeSwipe, Nibbly</dt>

<dd>Let’s be clear at the outset, an app that gives you summarised news or affordable homes or delicious food doesn’t qualify, as we are talking about Tinder for X model. Sadly only if a news or a house or a biriyani could swipe you right and give you that ego boost then we were done here.

The lack of ‘variable rewards’ &amp; ‘ego boost’ makes this model not so attractive. It’s clearly a case of wrong nomenclature when someone calls something like ‘News In Shorts’ a Tinder for X model.</dd>

</dl>

<p>To conclude, all these are frankly our opinions &amp; judgements, backed by data. Any reference to any startups living or shut down are completely intentional but not ill-intended at all.</p>

<p>We feel that any product could be tweaked to be awesome, not necessarily in Tinder model.  Please feel free to contact us - me &amp; my co-author Nivedan in case you’re facing any challenge with your cool product and we can help you with designing a product strategy to make it even more awesome.</p>

<p>We would love to know more from you about what you think are the reasons for the success of Tinder and similar products. Also, any other A for B models would be a great topic to discuss.</p>

        So, can coding be a lot easier ?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Feb 2016</span>

    <p>So most of us have had our share of interactions with developers, in some way or the other.
Luckily enough I have now been on both sides - and frankly the experience of creating things from scratch  as a developer has been overwhelming.
But then not being a <cite>‘techie’</cite> from Day One has left me pondering with certain things, and in this “Hello World” of LinkedIn Posts, I take up one of them.</p>

<p>The best part of my <em>tech-yatra</em> has been the discovery that there’s a a very strong &amp; active community around  development and StackOverflow is undoubtedly the best.
The support and exhaustiveness of the community is widespread which definitely helps.
But, as a rookie developer, 4 months ago, I was really torn apart in finding out relevant questions on StackOverflow, reading the top voted answers and then reading documentations as well whenever I faced an error statement.
To add to my woes, not all solutions were customised as per my requirement !</p>

<p>Now, obviously there’s a joy in learning non-linearly, figuring out things as we go but sometimes these ‘blocks’can be dangerous.
In fact, while at IIT, a major reason I discontinued coding was partially because of these ‘blocks’.
As Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the pioneer of the concept of ‘Flow’ and author of the book by same name ( a highly recommended read for all ) explains from the figure below, our challenges  need to be proportionate to our skill level for our continuous progress  - otherwise we often get stuck up in anxiety zones  with tough problems and we never progress onto the next level.
So, if the plan is to be on a steep learning curve or learn within limited time  (say, over weekends where you can’t waste time getting stuck up and lose inspiration to progress),  is there a solution to do programming an easier way ? Not so easy that it becomes boring but easy enough to be in ‘flow’.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Introduction.jpg" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>What if those guys who answer your questions on StackOverflow or people like them could answer your questions personally  and instantaneously ?
What if those moments of anxiety caused by getting stuck can be overcome easily with the help from experts who have relevant credible experience in that language/software/ framework  ?
Not an online tutor  (cause that pushes coding  into ‘boring’ zone ), but a chat-based assistant whom you could delegate the task of “StackOverflow”ing  things and helping you ASAP only when you’re stuck in a problem.
And by virtue of their own expertise in the language coupled with past experience of handling similar problems from other users, the help would arrive an user’s way far more earlier than their own efforts would have !</p>

<p>I would love to know your opinion, especially more if you’re starting out as a developer and otherwise also,
as to whether you would like to use a similar help at a monetary cost of say, less than 1k/year  and how badly would you need it for whatever reasons may be -
web, app, software development or data science applications, machine learning applications etc.</p>

<p>Would love to hear your opinion and feel free to contact me if this sounds interesting !</p>

<p>P.S. : Just to give a context of areas where I faced challenges, in past 4 months :  I was involved  extensively into building Machine Learning algorithms in fields of NLP, predictive analytics
while building a small Android application on the side. Currently, though I have been figuring out things on applications of  NLG and block-chain technology.</p>
