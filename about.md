Rohit here. Currently, working as <strong>Deep Learning Scientist</strong> at [qure.ai](https://blog.qure.ai). We are working on bio-medical imaging problems - mostly pathology and radiolgy problems, using Deep Learning in Computer Vision for early-stage diagnosis.

A 2014 grad from IIT-Bombay, ex-investment banker who sold his 'ferrari' to fund his startup. And then, in search of true 'nirvana' in form of truly impacting disruption, finally found my way to Qure. Before Qure, I had worked as Data Scientist for [ListUp](http://listup.co.in/), a P2P buy-sell platform and as Freelance Data Scientist for New York based startup [Data Science Labs](https://datascilabs.com/) and couple of other startups.

Apart from Deep Learning, I also keenly follow (at least like to follow) developments in Reinforcement Learning. Also, on weekends, I am mostly playing either playing tennis or at swimming pool. An avid hopelessly Hindi music buff, I like to read a lot on varied topics, and keep a tab on the newest breakthroughs in the startup scenario.  Hence, a varied lot of topics in the [blog](https://rohitghosh.github.io/).

In case you plan to collaborate or anything else, feel free to write to me : rohitghosh177 [at] gmail [dot] com
