Rohit here. Having fun in general through life, mostly. 


Previously was <strong>Founding Member</strong> at [Qure.ai](https://qure.ai) doing all the fun things from 0-1 (building the algos as AI researcher till 2018) and then 1-100 (commercialise tech as CCO till 2024, doing 0-1 across multiple market verticals). Qure.ai focuses on AI for medical imaging and is currently being used in 80+ countries, 2000+ provider sites globally ~as of 2024. The two phases couldn't have been more similar and yet so different. Doing zero to one, every other days couldn't have been more fun! 


I have also done a bunch of 'fun' things in the process till now

- Got to learn sales, started by selling frugally (_spamming, you say?_) and then be able to build a full fledged first principles based sales process to launch from 0 to $XX M+ ARR in 2-3 years; across 5 market vertials (_learning to lead commercial teams along the way - they work very differently from AI reasearch teams, haha!_)


- [TEDX talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUq3VabF93w) in the problem we're trying to solve the meantime talking about the journey of Qure  

- Got a chance to mentor and coach 200+ students as a faculty at GreyAtom. In collaboration with GreyAtom, we put out a series of [YouTube lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYRC9o9jyT8&list=PLLkSL3qYv6EK3kS98sqNAqSZsMqc8AhhV) on machine learning and AI which could help anyone get started with data science. 

- Worked with Google Developer Expert Group for machine learning to mentor/coach budding data scientists across the globe (mostly Tensoerflow though :P)

- As teaching machine learning very close to my heart, I also happened to co-author a book titled [Big Data Analytics: Systems, Algorithms, Applications](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=tJm2DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s) along with Prof. Prabhu and his student (_it was a lot of effort writing even few chapters!_)

- Got a chance to be Guest Lecturer at multiple places - like UpGrad, University of Mumbai etc. (_I love teaching students_)

- Built a RL-based trading 'agent' in 2019 for trading on India stock markets with my buddies Sushant and Jayant - (_the backtesting results looked much better than real-lfe results_). Still, it ran good till pandemics of 2020 ruined it !


### Fun Facts 

- I didn't know *how to code a single line in any language* at the begining of 2016, forget anything about deep learning or even machine learning or data structures and algorithms. Story for another day :)

- Now, I am pickleball bronze medalist for City of Sydney's Annual Pickleball Champinoship (_newest addition to fun things in life_)
