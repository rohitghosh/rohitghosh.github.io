Rohit here. Currently, working as <strong>Deep Learning Scientist</strong> at [qure.ai](https://blog.qure.ai). We are working on medical imaging problems using Deep Learning in Computer Vision for early-stage diagnosis.

A 2014 graduate from IIT Bombay, I had worked as Risk Analyst with Nomura right after graduation. I completed my CFA Level I in the same year while working at Nomura. Before my current role with Qure, I had worked as Data Scientist for [ListUp](http://listup.co.in/), a P2P buy-sell platform and as Freelance Data Scientist for New York based startup [Data Science Labs](https://datascilabs.com/) and couple of other startups.

I focus mostly on R&D areas in computer vision part of Deep Learning. In addition to vision, I also keenly follow developments in reinforcement learning (mostly related to trading strategies). Also, on weekends, I am mostly playing either playing tennis or at swimming pool. An avid Hindi music buff, I like to read on varied topics, and keep a tab on the newest breakthroughs. Hence, a varied lot of topics in the [blog](https://rohitghosh.github.io/).
