# Are All Sports (Watching) Created Equal?

People have different **likings** for different sports—a lot of it depends on upbringing and surroundings. If you live in the desert, chances are your liking for ice hockey might be lower than for field hockey. But it’s worth pondering: beyond your favourites, are we predisposed to liking certain sports more than others just because of the sport itself?

This is evidently based on my own experience and an attempt to decode what makes **watching** sports a great experience (which is different from **playing** sports—that might be altogether different).

## Time to a Result

Assuming you’re watching sports for entertainment, the core deciding factor is the **unlikelihood of the result**—with the likelihood of the result becoming clear as late as possible, without the result taking too long to arrive. As attention spans decline, the **duration it takes to decide a result**, as a factor for liking, is on a downward trajectory.

The sweet spot seems to be around **2–3 hours** now—almost competing with a movie. So that’s the first filter: **time it takes to decide the result**. This does rule out sports like **Test cricket** or **one-day cricket**, which can go over five days or a full day, as being attractive to a new, unintroduced viewer (for now—more on why this might change later).

## Unpredictability, and Where It Lives

Apart from time taken, the other piece is the **unpredictability of the result**—which can be spread across **time**, across **participants**, or both.

### Unpredictability Spread Over Time

Some games are designed to be more unpredictable throughout, while others are more likely to be decided quickly. To decode this variability, you need a finer metric: the amount of **unpredictability per unit time**.

If a **sub-session** of a game (a small unit of play) is short and can quickly end in either side’s victory, it’s more likely to attract attention than a sub-session that takes long to decide and/or has no result. That creates two more criteria to care about:

- **Length of the sub-session**
- **Number of sub-sessions that end with results**

For example, in football/soccer/hockey, sub-sessions (say, from one throw-in to the next or a free kick) can be moderately long, and most of them end **without** results—making them less attractive to me. Conversely, the **lack of short sub-sessions** is what makes sports like rowing a bit uninteresting to watch.

### Unpredictability Spread Across Participants

The last bit to unpack is the **distribution of unpredictability**: **two-player/team** vs **multi-player/team** sports. By “two-team,” I mean within a single session. Football and hockey are two-team sports, although tournaments include more participants. However, sports like **F1, swimming, golf, running,** and **rowing** are multi-player sports where multiple participants compete **simultaneously** in the same session. This spreads the unpredictability across many participants.

While this seems advantageous (more sources of uncertainty), the challenge is that it’s difficult to focus attention on any **one** player at a time. In practice, predictability is biased toward favourites, and most people end up rallying behind them—unless they have other reasons for separate favourites.

For a new, unintroduced audience, when likelihoods are too sparse and you can’t watch all participants in action together, two things happen:

1. You **lose context** of the game.
2. If you’re watching a **non-favourite** at any moment, you’re likely to be bored, since that moment feels less connected to the final result (at least in your mind).

That’s why most broadcasts in these sports focus on the favourites. And that’s why these sports are somewhat **contextual** for an unintroduced audience—more engaging when there are clear favourites.

So, while unpredictability of the outcome is great when it’s **spread over time**, it’s not as great when it’s **spread across players**. When it’s spread over time, your mind can follow it more closely because you can make sense of **binary outcomes** in each sub-session. When there are multiple outcomes at once—an **explosion** of outcomes per unit time across many players—it becomes cumbersome unless you arrive with favourites (which is hard for a new audience).

Sports like **javelin throw** and **golf** make this easier by having multiple players **take turns**, so at any unit of time there’s only **one** outcome to follow.

## A Simple Model

```
interest ≈ exp[−(time taken)] × (unpredictability spread over time)
--------------------------------------------------------
(unpredictability spread across players)
```


*Exponential because it functions like a gate: the rest of the expression only really matters when the time taken is low.*

## What This Explains

Clearly, sports like **tennis**, **table tennis**, and **badminton** stand out because they score high on all fronts: they take less time, involve a couple of players/teams at a time, and a point rarely takes more than a minute. Even **basketball** lives up to similar popularity for the same reasons.

## How Some Sports Could Adapt

Following the corollary, games like **football** and **hockey** could improve with a more relaxed rule for what counts as a goal and with fewer disruptions around throws. Imagine if **taking the ball past a certain line** (like in American football) counted as points, or if the **number of consistent passes** counted as mini-victories. That way, many more sub-sessions would result in outcomes.
